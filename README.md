# README

## Introduction
This repository hosts the source of the OGC API - Records Micro Website: https://records.developer.ogc.org

Currently, the website is served from the [gh-pages](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-records-website/tree/gh-pages) branch.

## Quick Start :rocket:

Clone this repository with:

`git clone https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-records-website.git`

Then enter the folder:

`cd ogc-records-website`

Install dependencies:

`npm install`

Start development server:

`npm start`

Once you start the development server, the site will be available at:

`http://localhost:3000`

The hot reload will ensure that the changes you do on the code will be reflected on the browser.

Commit all your changes to the `master` branch. **The `gh-pages` branch will be wiped each time, and generated dynamically from these [GitHub actions](https://github.com/opengeospatial/ogc-records-website/actions), which create a static build**. You don't need to do anything to publish the website - the republish will be triggered automatically with each push to `master`.
